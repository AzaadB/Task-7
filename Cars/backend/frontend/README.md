# How to obtain the app#

Click the link: https://github.com/AzaadB/Level_3_Task_7, then it should take you to my the github repository when there the should be a dropdown button called CODE click that, once you've clicked it you'll see an option Download Zip click that and it should download it and once it has extract the files inside and you should have the files.

# How to install the app#

Once you have downloaded it from Github and extracted the folder inside, type npm install to both the

React side and Express side, to do that you need to type cd "CARS" which means you are in the tasks folder which has the backend folder, and then type cd express which means you are in the Express

(backend) side, then type npm install which will install a folder called node_modules, once it has finished install, then type cd frontend which means you you are in the (frontend) side, then type npm install which will install a folder called node_modules, without the node_module folders installed, the appliction won't work.

# How the app was created#

This app was created using the MERN stack which is (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), The backend was created with Express and mongoose which is used to connect to MongoDB, which is a database where we store backend data. And in this task we use CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations to store data on MongoDB, so When we add, or update a new car in this task it is stored in MongoDB and when we delete a car it is also is removed from MongoDB.

# How to run the Application#

Once the App has installed run npm start on both the React(frontend)side and Express(backend) side, it will then open your browser and the app shoud display. Once it has you can start using it.

# How it works#

Once it has loaded in your browser, but MAKE SURE! the backend server is also running otherwise nothing will load on the page.

# What you can do on the app#

Once the app has loaded in the browser and the backend server is running, then you'll see all the cars that are stored in MogoDB, and on the right hand side of the page you'll see a form in which you can add a new car, you can also update, and deleta a car, and if you want to see the cars that are older than 5 years, there is a button on the right hand side of the navbar just click it and the cars that are older than 5 years will appear and if you want to go back to see all the cars just click the heading called CARS on the left side of the navbar and it will take you back. The only thing you won't be able to do is update all the cars at once.
